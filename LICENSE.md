Some Clarifications:
-- As long as our work (below) is cited/attributed, it is perfectly fine to use renderings/images of our CAD designs for use in articles and/or publications (academic or otherwise)
-- It is not our intent with the No-Derivative clause to prevent others from building on our work. We merely ask that users who expand upon our work to first work with us to try and incorporate the changes into the official OpenHand design library first. Our intent is to maintain a clear division between the official OpenHand designs that we have thoroughly tested, and non-official derivatives. This may change in the future, but for now, we are sticking with the Non-Commercial and Non-Derivative version of the CC license.
